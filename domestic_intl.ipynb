    "# StatCan Data on International and Domestic postsecondary institution (PSI) student enrolment, Academic Years (AY) 2009/10 - 2022/23, Full-time (FT) students only\n",
    "\n",
    "### Note on Enrolment vs Study permits issued (for international student analysis):\n",
    "- Study permits issued are a prerequisite to enrolment, but will not 100% translate into enrolment - some will not enrol for personal or other immigration related issues. More a leading indicator of demand. \n",
    "    - It is useful to look at permits issued though and [CBC's analysis pulled from IRCC Data](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/international-student-study-permits-data-1.7125827#Full%20data) used study permits issued as they focus specifically on the international student cap and the conduct of institutions that led to the federal decision. This will be explored later, but the project's initial aim was to look more holistically at the sector, hence data from domestic students is also included and analysis is framed in terms of how much of an institution's student populace has become international students, for what is likely financial and demographic factors (a flatline in domestic enrolment in almost every province.)\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Another issue of study permits being the leading indicator is the [no-show rate of students](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-international-students-school-attendance-data/). It was [only in November 2024](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/news/2024/11/new-international-student-program-regulations-take-effect.html) that any mandatory reporting of international student attendance, and study permit compliance began.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Enrolment is a realised, on the ground student paying tuition, therefore is a more concrete indicator of the institution's reality.\n",
    "\n",
    "- On 22 February I found [Retrenchment Watch](https://higheredstrategy.com/retrenchment-watch-newsletter/) by Higher Ed Strategy Associates, studying the response of the PSIs to this situation, who are also analysing data from the study permits issued month by month\n",
    "\n",
    "- Note from Dec 2025: There are many tables from StatCan providing similar postsecondary data around student status/demographic, but [this specific link](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/cv.action?pid=3710027701) was used previously in late 2024."

    "- Ontario's growth in international students is far greater than the other provinces even when taking population into account. They have quadrupled their number in ten years where others have doubled or made 2.5x and from a lower base. Ontario also looks like the province that got back up after COVID the quickest.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Quebec FR is among the lowest international %, suggesting this is probably not a Francophone phenomenon**. The QC French schools added international students like the BC average, but based on the size of the ecosystem it should have added more, were the Francophone system behaving like the English-speaking one. We have Ontario Francophone institutions and we can look for similar behaviour to Quebec FR to show that the Francophone ecosystem is changing at a different rate than the English one.  \n",

    "\n",
    "- BC started the highest Intl% and remains the highest but ON has all but caught up now. Later on it would be interesting to drill down further in previous years for Ontario and BC, to see how BC's demographics have changed and if it is more distinct. I would like to drill down into the school level and see how that is changing too.\n",

    "These schools over 50% now have the majority of their operations for international students. They are mostly small colleges with domestic enrolment in the 1,000 - 3,000 ballpark that have enrolled that number or multiple times that number in international students in this ten year period. They **rapidly transformed** into predominantly international service providers. Of the original six in 2011 over 20% international students, Centennial and Cape Breton are here, and CBU is typical of this agressive growth where they now service an international base over twice their domestic contingent.\n",

    "- Schools which already began the period with a significant international population like Centennial Centennial College, or \n",
    "- Those that added a lot of international students alongside a large domestic base like Seneca, Centennial, George Brown or York University. \n",
    "\n",
    "With domestic enrolment flatlined almost everywhere in Canada, it's not unreasonable that these previously small regional schools that have rapidly grown to multiples of their original size almost entirely off of international students. These schools are threatened the most with any restrictions to the flow of international students, as they cannot even rely on a sizeable domestic student populace to serve and receive funding.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ontario has the most explosive transformers** - Lambton College, Northern College, Canadore College, Algoma University, Cambrian College, Loyalist College and Conestoga College all began the period with at most 10% international student enrolment. With the exception of Conestoga College at 8000 domestic students, these were small sub-5000 student schools with 2011 international student numbers often in the hundreds. \n",
    "\n",
    "All of these schools entered 2021-22 with international students making at least the majorty of their student body, often multiple times the domestic count, like Lambton College which was around 85% international in 2021, and Algoma, Loyalist, Canadore and Northern College all above 67%.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Lambton College has strange data in 11-12 and 12-13 where Domestic enrolment then drops off a cliff for 13-14. I will check the MCU (provincial body) data for clarity, as it's more granular, but I suspect their domestic enrolment is around the 2-3k mark in 2011-2013.\n",

    "**BC's transformers were not nearly as explosive as those in Ontario**. No BC institution passed 60% international by 2021 which was a lower boundary for the explosive growers in Ontario. In BC, Coast Mountain College (CMC), Northern Lights College, Langara College, College of New Caledonia (CNC) Kwantlen Polytechnic University (KPU), Vancouver Community College (VCC) and Selkirk College grew the highest share of international students in their makeup, all starting 2011 with < 10% international and all touched or exceeded 40% at some point in the most recent 3-4 years of the reference period. Some have peaked and dropped off like CNC, but it may be COVID related in 2020-2021.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If we are trying to identify transformers as *small* schools that effectively changed their principal market from domestic to international, a *small school* is going to be smaller in BC than in ON by virtue of ON being nearly 3x the population. \n",
    "    - Langara began 2011 with 5,700 domestic students, KPU with 8,200 and this puts them in the category of  where the others were around 2,000 or below. Langara and KPU have both effectively become equal domestic and international students, closing a gap of 5.5-8k students.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Coast Mountain College and Northern Lights College are both sub-1000 domestic enrolment in 2011 so their ratios are going to be more sensitive to raw numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Transformers were often but not always colleges - Cape Breton University, Algoma University and Kwantlen Polytechnic University all rapidly grew in international students with a small domestic base."

    "We can draw a few conclusions from this work book:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Rapid growth and expansion of international student enrolment has occurred in the last 15 years against a flatlined domestic student populace across all of Canada.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pre- and Post-Covid, international student enrolment was growing exponentially when totalled at the nationwide level. However, this growth is concentrated overwhelmingly in Ontario, specifically in its colleges. The outcome is many ON colleges now serving more international students than domestic students (over 50% international student share of enrolment).\n",
    "    - The data in the Covid-impacted years of 20-21 and 21-22 sets Ontario's institutions apart. Domestic enrolment fell 13,700 Year-on-Year, whilst international enrolment increased by 45,000. They are the only large province that simultaneously lost domestic enrolmen (six times the next nearest provincial drop in BC) whilst growing international enrolment (over ten times Alberta's growth).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Many of these Ontario colleges were small institutions in 2011. Several were serving less than 2,500 domestic students and barely a few hundred international students. The transformation from small regional institution to international educational brand presumably has a lot of operational implications, depending on pre existing size, geographic location, program offering, etc..."

    "It is possible that these data are conservative estimates of international student enrolment in all PSIs, private and public.  I have not yet found comprehensive 2023/24 data but according to this [January 2024 article](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-number-of-international-students-now-exceeds-one-million-official/#:~:text=An%20IRCC%20document%20from%20August,over%20one%20million%20in%202024.), there were then more than 1 million approved study permit holders in Canada. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is 600,000 more than the 430,000 I found in 22/23 in this workbook. This might include K-12 students, but it is unclear, and frustratingly the Globe and Mail don't specify or provide the 'official sources' data quoted in the above article to examine.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data for Ontario Colleges, with PCPPs that drove a lot of international student growth, are likely worth exploring specifically. \n",
    "- Ontario MCU's [Policy Directive on PCPPs is here](https://files.ontario.ca/mcu-public-college-private-partnerships-march-2023-en-2023-03-14.pdf) which outlined 7,500 students max through these schemes, which can be assessed against the enrolment they are required to report by campus, which is available from MCU's data centre\n",
    "- [Analysis of PCPPs by HEQC in Ontario](https://heqco.ca/pub/public-college-private-partnerships-lessons-learned-for-ontarios-postsecondary-education-system/) - paper explores the enrolment in the PCPP programs against labour market needs via job postings - I will look at the CIP list by IRCC\n",

Institutions like University Canada West in Vancouver which has [over 14,000 students](https://www.ucanwest.ca/about/overview-facts) do not report information to PSIS.\n",
    "- There are a number of public-private college partnerships in Ontario where a private (for profit) college is licenced to deliver a public college's curriculum, and other private colleges where transfer mechanisms to public colleges exist. However, it was [only in November 2024](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/news/2024/11/new-international-student-program-regulations-take-effect.html) that any mandatory reporting of international student attendance, and study permit compliance began. It's not clear if the enrolment at those would count under the public college (presumably then I have captured it from StatCan) or with the private college.\n",
    "- This [CBC article](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/international-student-study-permits-data-1.7125827#Full%20data) show approved study permits in 2023 at around 430,000 which tracks with my numbers for 2022-23."
