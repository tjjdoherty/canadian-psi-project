    "The data for Ontario Colleges, with PCPPs that drove a lot of international student growth, are likely worth exploring specifically. \n",
    "- [Ontario MCU's Policy Directive on PCPPs](https://files.ontario.ca/mcu-public-college-private-partnerships-march-2023-en-2023-03-14.pdf). Stipulates a maximum of 7,500 international students enrolled through these schemes, which we can examine here. Which schools got close to this figure / exceeded it, if this rule came in as a revision to the original directive.\n",
    "- [Analysis of PCPPs by HEQC in Ontario](https://heqco.ca/pub/public-college-private-partnerships-lessons-learned-for-ontarios-postsecondary-education-system/) - paper explores the enrolment in the PCPP programs against labour market needs via job postings - I will look at the CIP list by IRCC\n",
    "\n",
    "- [List of PCPPs in Ontario](https://pcici.ca/public-private-partnership-colleges-ontario/). Verify these in conjunction with Ontario enrolment from MCU, which lists enrolment by Campus\n",
    "    - From HEQC above: *A moratorium on new partnerships between 2017 and 2019 followed a government review that documented risks associated with the partnership arrangements. Identified risks included quality assurance and the impact of enrolment growth on students, institutions and the system (Trick, 2017). **At that time, six colleges operated nine PCPP programs.*** Find out who.\n",
    "    - Also scrape their websites to see program offerings and what may have changes (now in 2025)\n",
