    "Following on from looking at domestic and international enrolment, this notebook examines program and credential specific enrolment including field of study. This is to get a more precise understanding of programs and their enrolment contributing to tuition fee revenue, which may be at risk. \n",

    "\n",
    "The new Federal IRCC rules of 2024 restricts the number of international study permits issued and Post-Graduate Work Permits (PGWP) availability, according to the program/credential type, length of the program and field of study. The field-of-study requirement further complicates the picture of enrolment and revenue changes for specific schools and offers another dimension to this situation - which programs and fields of study have proliferated and are they what the government believes we are most in need of?\n",

No time deducted from length of future PGWP for studies outside of Canada.\n",

    "    - For example there are 509,000 Credential type: Diploma students across all of Canada in 22/23 and 386k of them are in 'Career, Technical or Professional Training Program' Program Type. 85k of these are sitting under 'Pre-University Program' (of 87k total in the Pre-uni category) which makes me think there are PSIs classifying a High School diploma, which wouldn't impact tuition fees. The remaining 55k are scattered across various other program types\n",
    "    - Certificate credentials are clearer - of 190k in Canada, almost all are captured in the 'Career, Technical or Professional Training Program', 'Post Career, Technical or Professional Training Program' or Undergraduate.\n",
    "    - *Post career, technical or professional training program* specifically includes **Ontario graduate certificate programs**\n",

I only imported the student enrolment from full programs - there were around 100,000 enrolments (out of 2.2m total enrolments in all programs) in 'non-program' some were non credit, some undergraduate, some graduate, I assume this meant students taking individual classes to complete programs at a later date, and not an end-to-end program enrolment on a schedule.\n",

Domestically there is a slight overrepresentation of ON and QC in these programs.

The other major provinces stayed relatively constant or declined slightly.\n",

    "As mentioned this is a strange category because the Domestic and international landscapes look entirely different. This seems to be a categorisation for graduate non-degree programs like certificates and diplomas but Ontario does not use them in this way. The growth of Nova Scotia in this category from 33 international students in 2016, to 2325 students in 2022 is also notable, this clearly was not a viable program before and rapidly became one. Given the work looking at international enrolment in the previous workbook, I lean towards this being from Cape Breton U who were very active in growing their international contingent."

    "The distributions are incredibly stable down to the fractions of a percentage point in some cases. This is true of both domestic and international, despite most of the provinces roughly doubling their international enrolment numbers in that period. The fact for international students they did this almost in tandem has kept the picture the same. Overall, the growth in numbers of Master's degree international students is in the tens of thousands and was described as stable/sustainably growing by IRCC when they introduced the study permit cap in January 24."

    "For the first question above, the medical residency programs were remarkably close to the provincial population shares, rough shares of which are 39% in ON, 23% in QC, 13.5% in BC, 11.5% in BC and below 4% for everybody else.\n",
    "\n",
    "Master's and PhD degrees were also fairly close to the distributions, although Masters were more characterised by being incredibly stable over the 6 year period despite adding about 30,000 students across the country in every major province.\n",
    "\n",
    "In PhD programs steady growth was seen in both domestic and international students but surprisingly ON trails QC by the number of international PhD candidates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Undergraduates, the biggest cohort by far, are slightly leaning into Ontario disproportionately more than population would suggest. This is true of domestic and international students, but the international market is a little more volatile and has been captured by Ontario more, almost 50% of international UG students are there.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most dramatic changes and imbalances are in the Career and Post-career Technical/Professional training programs and ON simply blows everybody away here. There are some unusual quirks like post-baccalaureate being used in BC showing similar, but less aggressive, changes than the technical programs.\n",

Ontario does lose around 35,000 domestic students in this category between 2016 and 2022 (down 30%) while other provinces hold steady, perhaps only slightly decline here.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Internationally, ON is absolutely dominant with nearly two-thirds of international students in Canada taking these programs in Ontario in 2016. This rises to nearly three-quarters by 2022 by adding a further 60,000 international students.\n",
    "\n",
