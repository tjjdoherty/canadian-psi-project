    "Following on from looking at domestic and international enrolment, this notebook examines program and credential specific enrolment including field of study. This is to get a more precise understanding of programs and their enrolment contributing to tuition fee revenue, which may be at risk. \n",

    "\n",
    "The new Federal IRCC rules of 2024 restricts the number of international study permits issued and Post-Graduate Work Permits (PGWP) availability, according to the program/credential type, length of the program and field of study. The field-of-study requirement further complicates the picture of enrolment and revenue changes for specific schools and offers another dimension to this situation - which programs and fields of study have proliferated and are they what the government believes we are most in need of?\n",

Students may begin their classes while outside Canada and complete up to 50% of their program via distance learning if they cannot travel to Canada sooner. No time deducted from length of future PGWP for studies outside of Canada.\n",

    "    - **Graduate (third cycle) is PhD**\n",

    "\n",
    "2. I'm using **up to 2022/23 enrolment data, and 2023/2024 tuition fee figures**, the latest available. From there we can update with live data on enrolment as it becomes official, and project scenarios with hypothetical declines in student enrolment to estimate revenue changes into the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The easiest distinction is at Program Type, between undergraduate and graduate degrees for their tuition fee costs. However, you need to look at Credential Type for certificates and diplomas (popular at the colleges)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. There is inconsistency in where graduate diplomas/certificates sit in 'program type'.\n",
    "    - For example there are 509,000 Credential type: Diploma students across all of Canada in 22/23 and 386k of them are in 'Career, Technical or Professional Training Program' Program Type. 85k of these are sitting under 'Pre-University Program' (of 87k total in the Pre-uni category) which makes me think there are PSIs classifying a High School diploma, which wouldn't impact tuition fees. The remaining 55k are scattered across various other program types\n",
    "    - Certificate credentials are clearer - of 190k in Canada, almost all are captured in the 'Career, Technical or Professional Training Program', 'Post Career, Technical or Professional Training Program' or Undergraduate.\n",
    "    - *Post career, technical or professional training program* specifically includes **Ontario graduate certificate programs**\n",
    "\n",
    "5. I only imported the student enrolment from full programs - there were around 100,000 enrolments (out of 2.2m total enrolments in all programs) in 'non-program' some were non credit, some undergraduate, some graduate, I assume this meant students taking individual classes to complete programs at a later date, and not an end-to-end program enrolment on a schedule.\n",
    "6. The above analysis was done on full-time and part time students. As with my analysis earlier, I am only taking full-time PSI student data (a total of 1.7m in Canada)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "All this is to say the calculations here will be estimates at best, with the heavy lifting being done by the difference between domestic and international tuition fees mostly at the undergraduate and graduate degree level, as these are the most numerous and require somewhat less granularity than fees for certificates/diplomas."

    "- As we go forward, we should spot check enrolment in certain program types and credential types with the international enrolment from combined_df. There are probably going to be at least some inconsistencies in how a 'diploma' or 'certificate' is categorized and the average tuition fee values we're working with mean these will be informed estimates at best. But there should not be instances where specific programs / credentials have more enrolment than entire 'international' or 'domestic' students from combined_df."
